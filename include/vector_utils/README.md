NOTE: Throughout these interfaces, conditional preprocessing directives are
used to support building working versions of the example applications that
depend on them as they are presented in the textbook.

These directives are used solely to avoid rewriting code that does not change
across successive example applications and to demarcate the inclusion of new
features that become necessary as the example applications that depend on these
interfaces become more complex.

Ultimately, this technique only serves as a means to adapt this project's build
system to one's learning environment.
