This repository contains the programming examples I made when working through
the book ***Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++, 2nd Edition*** by
Bjarne Stroustrup.

I created this repository as part of a code preservation project and to serve
as a general programming reference.

For the code examples as provided by the book, visit:
