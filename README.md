This repository contains the programming examples I made when working through
the book ***Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++, 2nd Edition*** by
Bjarne Stroustrup.

This project is meant to serve as a general programming reference to anyone
learning C++, teaching C++, and/or also working through the textbook.

For more information about the textbook, visit:
