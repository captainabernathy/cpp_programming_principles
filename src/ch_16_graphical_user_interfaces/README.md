NOTE: Throughout the interface to and implementation of the Lines\_window
class, conditional preprocessing directives are used to support building
working versions of the example applications that depend on the Lines\_window
class as they are presented in the textbook.

These directives are used solely to avoid rewriting code that does not change
across successive example applications and to demarcate the inclusion of new
features that become necessary as the example applications that depend on the
Lines\_window class become more complex.

Ultimately, this technique only serves as a means to adapt this project's build
system to one's learning environment.
